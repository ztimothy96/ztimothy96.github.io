title: About me
---
Hi there! I'm an autodidactic artist who likes to admire and create beautiful things. What makes something beautiful? Keats offered a perspective in his "Ode on a Grecian Urn,"

> Beauty is truth, truth beauty, â€”that is all. Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

By weaving simple ideas into mesmerizing patterns, art can express universal truths, helping us to see the world in a new light. While mathematics explains the inner workings of nature, music gives voice to the subconscious human psyche. Long after humans have vanished from the earth, these patterns will remain, their dazzling gems waiting to be discovered again by whichever sentient life form springs up next. But isn't it wonderful that we can appreciate their beauty while we're still here?

It's a bit hard to succinctly describe everything I do, but here are a few of my recurring interests: 

## Math and CS

I studied pure maths in college and was quite good at it, earning a top 500 score in the 2017 Putnam Competition and publishing a paper in NeurIPS 2019. At that point, I became fascinated by the intersection of algorithms research and machine learning, so I pursued PhD research from 2019 to 2021 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Due to shifting research interests and priorities during the COVID lockdowns, I dropped out to work in the software industry. In 2023, I started working on some data science projects, and I'm excited to see where this new journey will take me!

## Music

I consider music composition my "second career." It doesn't make me any money, but I find a great source of meaning in expressing my emotional state. I also perform piano frequently at Meetup groups around the Bay Area. For more details, check out:
- my dedicated music blog, [decomposings](https://decomposings.wordpress.com), and
- my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TimothyZhou0). I mostly post recordings of my compositions, but beware: I am much better at performing live than at sound engineering and music production...

## Other
At some point, I have also dabbled in philosophy, chess, poetry, badminton, long-distance running, public speaking, and other various topics. Sometimes I am good at things, and sometimes I am not.

My Lichess handle is [yummyricecakes](https://lichess.org/@/yummyricecakes). I have a blitz rating of 2200+ and a rapid rating of 2300+. Someday I would like to compete in tournaments again and earn a National Master's title.
