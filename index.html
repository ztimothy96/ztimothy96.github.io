    "Technology (noun): the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving
    practical goals."

    This is a technical blog, although not in the widest possible
    sense of the word. I started it in my PhD years as a space to share research
    reports and interesting math problems, but then life got crazy. Since I somehow ended up
    working in the tech industry, I suppose I ought to get extremely good at it. Here
    I'll write about nerdy things like software engineering, data science, and maybe
    even a little bit of math or chess if time permits.

    I think life is more generally a lot like a giant math puzzle.
    We can effectively navigate it in the same way that we solve algorithm problems:
    by building toy models about how the world works and then min-maxing the heck out of the system.
    But I'm not going to tell anyone how to do it; that's an exercise left to the reader! (Wink.)
