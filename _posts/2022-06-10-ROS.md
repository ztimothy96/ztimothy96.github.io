Someday, I would like to work in robotics, computer vision, or another specialized niche related to computer science. While it's hard to say when I'll be able to hop on a project, in the meantime I can still learn useful skills.

Let's begin with the [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org) (ROS), a platform for developing robotic applications. Robots have distributed components that need to pass information to each other, but that's not very exciting, and we'd rather not rewrite this protocol for each robot. Fortunately, ROS handles all these low-level details, so that we can focus on making our robot perform a specific task.

There are many online ROS tutorials, but I don't find them helpful because they get bogged down in unimportant details. Instead, I'm going to cover the basic concepts behind ROS, and that should be enough information to start reading real robotics programs.

## Basic concepts
ROS implements how robotic parts communicate with each other. There are two main concepts in ROS: nodes and topics.

- *Nodes*. Robots are made up of many programs that perform independent tasks, called nodes. For instance, the robot might need sensors, actuators, and path planners. 
- *Topics*. While nodes generate messages, topics transport messages from node to node. Each topic has a name and a type of message that it transports. 

Nodes can use topics to communicate in one of three ways.
- *Publishers and subscribers.* ROS follows a publisher-subscriber pattern: any node can publish messages to a topic as long as it supplies the right message type. Other nodes can subscribe to the topic and view the latest messages. The communication is anonymous, so subscribers don't know who published messages, and publishers don't know which subscribers received their messages. 

  Publisher-subscriber patterns are useful when publishers send frequent message updates and don't care which subscribers receive them. For instance, a laser scanner node might publish an occupancy grid while it maps an environment. Then, a display node might subscribe to that topic and display the latest map on a screen. It doesn't really matter if the display misses a few messages, as long as the map gets updated once in a while.
  
  However, sometimes we *do* want to ensure that a particular node receives some messages. For that, ROS offers other communication patterns:

- *Services.* Nodes can also act as clients and servers. A client node can call a server node and ask it to perform a particular task. For instance, we might request the robot to stop everything else it's doing and spin around 180 degrees. Services require two message types: requests (to tell the server what to do) and responses (to deliver the service results to the client). Services are *blocking* processes, so the server node won't do anything else until it's finished performing the service.

- *Actions.* Nodes can also perform actions, which are like non-blocking services. Actions require three message types: a goal (request), a result (response), and feedback (useful for sending miscellaneous information while performing the action). Each node can only perform one goal from an action at a time, but it can continue to run other processes that are not related to that action. Requesting a new goal from the same action will abort the previous goal. 

## Filesystem
If you open up a robotics project, you'll notice that there are a lot of folders and scripts floating around with similar names, which can seem confusing at first. This is because ROS projects have to be set up in a particular way.

- *Workspace.* This is the root folder of a project; everything related to the project should live in the workspace. ROS uses Catkin to build source code into binary executable files. As such, it organizes different kinds of files into different folders.
  - *src*: this folder contains source code, so it's where all the programming happens.
  - *devel*: this mostly contains setup files for the ROS environment. It's not that important.
  - *build*: this is where the binaries go when they're built.

- *Packages.* A package is just a collection of nodes that perform tasks together. For instance, nodes that receive visual data or process images might belong together in a computer vision package. Each package will have certain files and subdirectories.
  - *CMakeLists.txt.* This file lists the different source files along with the binaries that ROS needs to build. For instance, when we define custom message types for ROS topics, we can create message files under `path_to_pkg/msg/msg_name.msg`, and tell CMakeLists.txt to build them under the `add_msg_files` section.
  - *package.xml.*: This file lists basic information about the package, like its authors, version number, and a brief description. It also includes dependencies needed to build, run, test the package, etc. This allows ROS to install all dependencies by running `rosdep install package_name`. Alternatively, we can install all dependencies with `rosdep` install â€“from-paths . --ignore-src -y`.
  - *scripts/*. Python scripts go here.
  - *src/*. C++ source code goes here.
  - *Launchfile*. Naively, we would have to run the package by starting a new terminal for every single node and calling its binary, but when a robot has hundreds of nodes, this might take a while. Instead, launch files let us start all the nodes from one terminal. 

That's all I needed to know about ROS to start reading a real robotics stack! Sure, CMakeLists.txt and launch files have their own syntax and little rules to follow, but it's not that hard to tweak existing examples or Google for more information. Next, I should probably learn how to simulate environments in Gazebo and URDF.
