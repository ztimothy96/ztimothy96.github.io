I used to play a lot of chess. Actually, I reached a peak rating of 2080 USCF in high school, but then decided that spending time on math and music felt more rewarding. Although I don't play much chess nowadays, the process of improving taught me several life lessons which I still find valuable. Here are a few which come to mind.

## Learn from your mistakes
My grandfather used to coach the Chinese national chess team, and when he came to visit he would challenge me to play. Obviously I lost every single game. At first, the experience of getting crushed 100 games in a row was so traumatizing for my 9-year-old self that I fled into my room and cried. But eventually, I decided that I really wanted to win against him someday, and that meant I had a lot of studying to do.

In retrospect, this was the best possible way to improve: play someone much better than me, lose repeatedly, and learn from my mistakes. Chess taught me to acknowledge my weaknesses. There are clear rules, everyone starts with the same resources, there's no random chance, and there's a winner and a loser. When I lost, it was entirely my fault, so I had to figure out where I messed up. Well, I didn't have to, but I might as well get something positive out of the experience. "Never play a game without analyzing it afterward," the grown-ups told me; "otherwise, you're just wasting your time."

My incredibly long losing streak also taught me one meaning of the proverb, "experience is the best teacher." Mistakes are painful, so making them is a great way to remember and avoid them in the future. Seeing other people get wiped out by a [windmill attack](https://www.chess.com/terms/windmill-chess) isn't nearly as effective as experiencing the destruction yourself.

Much of what I've said here applies to improving and learning at other activities too, so I won't go into much further detail. The academic literature says plenty about the concepts of "grit," "growth mindset," and "deliberate practice," and I might write more about them in the future.

## Stay objective
For a long time, I came to every chess game asking myself, "how can I win?" I believed that, if I was clever and persistent enough, I could find the resources to break through the enemy defenses and win the game. If a position was extremely complicated, and there were many lines to calculate, I had to check all the temptingly beautiful sacrifices, and I was often disappointed to realize they didn't work.

While an optimistic attitude works wonders sometimes, it isn't rooted in objective truth. As I climbed higher and higher up the rating ladder, people made fewer mistakes. Eventually I realized that with perfect play, the game is probably a draw, so I shouldn't expect to win. Instead of asking myself, "how can I win," I shifted the question slightly to "how can I find a good move?" I started focusing on the process rather than speculating about results.

This insight might sound trivial, but it improved my chess dramatically (200 ELO points). I became more aware of possible dangers, so I learned to avoid creating weaknesses. Instead of looking at shiny sacrifices that didn't work, I learned to content myself with making small improvements to my position. Crucially, I started thinking more about chess as a science rather than an art. I learned to carefully analyze a position and select the plan that seemed objectively most promising.

I think this lesson applies to life more generally. When making decisions, it's a good idea to begin by gathering information and assessing what's possible. Inflated expectations lead unnecessary risk and disappointment, while defeatist ones cause us to miss out on promising opportunities. I strive to be neither an optimist nor a pessimist, but rather a realist.

## Adapt to changes
Chess is a game of planning and strategic thought, but it turns out that these plans are pretty short-term. This is because the game is too complicated, and it's more efficient to keep your options open.

Popular chess books often say things like, "here Alekhine made a deep positional plan that he carried out for the next 40 moves." This almost never happens, because you can't really predict what other people are going to do. This is especially true if you're playing a zero-sum game and the opponent tries their best to make your life miserable.

In reality, Alekhine probably set a short-term plan which was easy to carry out; something like "maneuver this knight to a threatening outpost within 3 turns." His opponent might have responded in various ways, each with different drawbacks. Alekhine then exploited whichever concession they decided was the lesser evil. This iterative process of improvement and reassessment creates a dialogue between the two players, gradually leading the game to its logical conclusion. An observer, impressed by how one decision led naturally to the next, might come away with the illusion of a "grand plan" envisioned from the beginning, when really the game could have diverged in a thousand different ways. Alekhine did not worry about all those other possibilities; he simply focused on how to find good moves in the position before him.

Real life is much more complicated than chess games. Interests change, friendships fade, disasters strike (the recent pandemics, for instance). A soulmate might randomly waltz into your world. The universe is crazy and chaotic and unpredictable, and the flap of a butterfly's wings can change the trajectory of human history. It's pointless to make plans too far into the future, because they will quickly become obsolete. Instead, I try to make only short-term plans, leaving options open so that I can quickly adapt to changes that appear on the horizon.

## P.S.
Over the years, I have started to find the game of chess itself less interesting. Once I figured out that the game was about adapting to changes and methodically increasing the activity of my pieces, further improvement mostly required learning to execute plans accurately in typical positions. This process started to feel like a grind, and not very creative. Spending this much effort studying a board game seemed a bit pointless, so I started to focus on math and music instead.

I also admit that I could have learned the same lessons in many other ways besides playing chess. After all, generic skills like "learn from your mistakes" or "stay objective" are necessary to improve at almost *any* activity. Sometimes, I wish I had picked a hobby which was more sociable, and which I would find fun even after I got better at it (for example, an athletic or speech team). Nonetheless, I appreciate the life lessons that I learned from chess along the way, and I'm glad it instilled perserverance in me so early in life.
