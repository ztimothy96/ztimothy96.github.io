I have been thinking about how most relationships are transactional. This is perfectly healthy; while we should show unconditional *love* to everyone we meet, we do not have to befriend or even *like* everyone. The Bible even teaches its followers to love their worst enemies, while remaining "shrewd as snakes and innocent as doves." Innocent, in that we avoid taking vengeance; shrewd, in that we don't actively try to make friends with people who will likely harm us. Since we are finite human beings with limited time on this earth, it's only natural for us to carefully select who to invest that time into.

However, while all friendships are transactional, not all friendships are created equal. Different people try to extract different kinds of value out of their relationship, so friendships can vary in their degree of transactionality depending on *what* exactly both parties are exchanging. 

As usual, Aristotle got it right over 3000 years ago, when he made his now-famous classification of friendships. According to his *Nicomachean Ethics*, there are three kinds of friendships: those which transact utility, pleasure, and character respectively. There's a great summary article titled [Three Lessons from Aristotle on Friendship](https://theconversation.com/three-lessons-from-aristotle-on-friendship-200520) by Prof. Emily Katz, which I recommend for those interested in learning more. In this post, I'll focus more on the value being transacted in each kind of relationship.

When people think of "transactional relationships," they often specifically mean friendships of utility. Such friendships derive value from the external benefits that other people provide us, and not the people themselves. We may befriend someone at a networking event so they can help us launch a high-paying career; here we only value career growth, but we care relatively little about the nature of the person helping us. It is not *wrong* to transact utility in this way, as long as both parties are aware that they're entering a business agreement and don't expect any deeper from the relationship.

Then there are friendships of pleasure, which derive value from the pleasurable feelings that arise when parties interact. These feel a little more personal than friendships of utility since we value something about the other party's personality: namely, they have to be socially adept enough to give us happy feelings when we talk to them. In such relationships, the two parties may hang out and enjoy conversations or shared activities. What bonds the two together are common interests or perhaps surface-level personality traits. But again, these relationships are not exactly intimate.

Finally, there is the highest and most intimate kind of friendship: that which derives value from character. Here the two parties do not concern themselves with external fluff like what utility they can extract from the other, or whether it's pleasurable to be around them. Instead, their friendship is based on a mutual admiration of their deepest selves: shared ethical values and beliefs. It is focused exclusively on *who* they are. In some circles, this is the only form of "true friendship," as it is the only form that requires the parties to deeply understand the other.

As Prof. Katz points out in her article, all forms of friendship have an important role to play in a fulfilling life. Since it takes great time and emotional investment to build a friendship of character, most people can only manage to juggle a few of them -- maybe five. Even Jesus, the paragon of universal love, only took in 12 disciples and not 120, for the simple reason that he would not have time to teach them all. And it is not exploitative to form friendships of utility or pleasure, as long as both parties are aware of this and expect nothing more. Kant's maxim, "never treat a person as merely a means to an end," does not forbid us from using others as a means toward our goals; it only reminds us to treat them with dignity as well. As long as these expectations are made clear, all friendships can be good.

How to tell what kind of friend you've made? One way is to take things away from the relationship and observe when people decide to leave you. For this reason, Aristotle comments that friendships of utility and pleasure are easier to break up; as soon as one party does not provide services that are *useful* to the other, or as soon as they do not make the other feel *pleasurable*, then the other will leave. These are the friendships that most people refer to when they talk about "transaction," because they treat the friend primarily as a means to an end: namely utility or pleasure.

For this reason, we tend to laud the friendships of character as more resilient to conflict. People who are "true friends" with each other will continue to exercise their friendship, even if one of them is struggling in life, creating problems and stress for the other. The other values them only for their character, so they will feel willing to help the friend that they love, even if the process makes them feel terribly unhappy. These are the friendships that many would call "untransactional." Even though there are still strings attached to the friendship, these conditions reflect the values of the other party, so they are focused on the friend as a means rather than an end. The good that one derives from the relationship is the privilege of walking through life together with someone they admire, and nothing else.

Sadly, while friendships of character are as nontransactional as most human relationships will ever get, they are still conditioned on the friend's character. And while character changes much more rarely than utility or pleasure, sometimes it does. On the occasions when two people's values drift further and further away from each other, they may begin to feel that their friend is no longer the person they used to admire; they may not even *like* each other anymore. And then, the friendship dies.

### P.S.
A brief tangent on romantic relationships: I believe that an ideal romantic relationship rests upon a friendship that is primarily based on character. After all, in long-term relationships, people often fall into stressful situations; some may even get sick and become unable to take care of themselves. It would feel pretty horrible to then watch your partner walk out on you because you're no longer "providing value" to them. Instead, a healthy relationship would see both partners accept the risk of possibly taking care of the other, with the understanding that their partner would do the same for them if needed. 

Unfortunately, in practice we see primarily friendships of utility and pleasure; people who pursue these ends go by nicknames such as "gold-diggers" and "playboys." Don't even get me started on the question of whether there is any real friendship between "friends with benefits." I find that older generations tend to view marriage as a transaction of utility, especially in those who grew up in third-world countries, where the struggle to survive took precedence over all else. Meanwhile, younger generations that grow up in affluent countries like the US tend to prioritize pleasure, such as the giddy feelings of butterflies that surface when one first develops a crush. A few, who care about spirituality and self-growth, may value relationships for the "learning experience" or "self-growth" that they promote; such values sound lofty, but they are ultimately utilities to extract from other people. It seems that very few people are willing to put in the hard work of nurturing a friendship of character for the sake of character.

Once again, I don't think there is anything *wrong* with the other kinds of friendships. It's perfectly fine to dig for gold or hunt for a pretty face, as long as both sides are open and communicate what they want from the other. It's only when two people want different kinds of friendships, and one begins hiding their motivations from the other, that one side might start to feel ripped off.
