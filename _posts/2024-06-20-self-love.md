I've often heard well-meaning people inform me that if only I loved myself, I wouldn't need intimate relationships with others in my life; therefore, if I ever feel lonely, I must not love myself. But what does it mean exactly to "love one's self?" And is it all that pop culture gurus claim it's cracked up to be? Will it really solve all our problems and remove the need for external companionship?

## Some ancient perspectives
There are many views on self-love, regarding what it is, and whether it is good or evil. At the time of writing, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-love) helpfully summarizes a few perspectives from the major world religions:

> Gautama Buddha (c. 563-483 BC) and Buddhism believe that the desires of the self are the root of all evil.
>
> The Hindu arishadvargas (major sins) are short-term self-benefiting pursuits that are ultimately damaging. These include mada (pride)...
>
> Nicomachean Ethics Book 9, Chapter 8 focuses on it \[self-love\] particularly. In this passage, Aristotle argues that people who love themselves to achieve unwarranted personal gain are bad, but those who love themselves to achieve virtuous principles are the best sort of good. He says the former kind of self-love is much more common than the latter. 
>
> Jesus (c. 4 BC-30 AD) prioritised the loving of God, and commanded his followers to love others selflessly, following his example. Early follower of Jesus, Paul the Apostle wrote that inordinate self-love was opposed to love of God in his letter to the Phillipian church...
>
> Christian monk Evagrius Ponticus (345–399) believed excessive self-love (hyperēphania – pride) was one of eight key sins. His list of sins was later lightly adapted by Pope Gregory I as the "seven deadly sins"... Under this system, pride is the original and most deadly of the sins...
>
> Augustine (354–430) – with his theology of evil as a mere distortion of the good – considered that the sin of pride was only a perversion of a normal, more modest degree of self-love.

It seems that most traditions agree that there is a healthy degree of self-love, but that it can easily cross into the ugly territory of pride. Moreover, it can become distorted to focus on worldly gain rather than the development of inner virtue. Well, then, what form of self-love do we find most prevalent in the present day?

## A modern therapist's perspective

I like Dr. Sharon Martin's description of self-love on [Psych Central](https://psychcentral.com/blog/imperfect/2019/05/what-is-self-love-and-why-is-it-so-important). She succinctly defines the term and clears up some misconceptions surrounding it:

> Self-love means that you accept yourself fully, treat yourself with kindness and respect, and nurture your growth and wellbeing... Self-love encompasses not only how you treat yourself but also your thoughts and feelings about yourself...
>
> When you love yourself, you have an overall positive view of yourself. This doesnt mean you feel positive about yourself all the time. That would be unrealistic! For example, I can temporarily feel upset, angry, or disappointed with myself and still love myself. If this is confusing, think about how this works in other relationships. I can love my son even though I sometimes feel angry or disappointed with him. Even in the midst of my anger and disappointment, my love for him informs how I relate to him. It allows me to forgive him, consider his feelings, meet his needs, and make decisions that will support his wellbeing. Self-love is very much the same. Which means, if you know how to love others, you know how to love yourself!

Given this understanding, I can safely say that I love myself very much. There are many things that I like about myself (like genuine altruism), and many things I don't (like weak self-discipline), but I fully acknowledge my flaws and strive to improve a little bit every day. I work hard to build a life where I can someday be happy and free, and that is brutally difficult sometimes, but I think it's worth it. That's what self-love should be: simply caring about one's well-being.

However, note that self-love does *not* solve all our problems. As Dr. Martin points out, a person who loves themselves may not feel happy all the time, or even *like* themselves all the time. It's okay to feel angry and disappointed at our failings because it shows that we love ourselves enough to care about improving ourselves. We can feel angry, so long as we also learn to control that anger for good purposes and eventually forgive ourselves.

By extension, I posit that self-love also does not cure loneliness. Think about it in terms of loving someone else: if I were to hear that someone I loved was stranded on a desert island, isolated from all human contact and going a little crazy from not having anyone to talk to, I wouldn't think that they need to boost their self-esteem! Instead, I would think that humans have a natural desire to be around others who care about them, and I would try to rescue them from that island. Self-love manifests not as an escape from loneliness, but as the *desire* to feel safe and seen by other human beings. Loving yourself means wanting good things for yourself, even if you can't immediately make those dreams come true.

(This is one area where I vehemently reject the Buddhist suppression of desires. Saint Augustine would probably consider such desires very much within the bounds of normal, healthy human functioning.)

But why do so many people insist that self-love cures all loneliness? I suspect this idea arose as an overreaction against a common problem we see on the dating market: neediness.

## Neediness and narcissism
It turns out that many people today are *needy*, having low self-esteem and craving external validation to feel better. And what better way to attain that validation than in a romantic context? A 2016 study by [Ranzini and Lutz](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2050157916664559) suggests that women use Tinder more often for seeking attention and self-validation than actually searching for relationships. (Not that the men are any better; you can probably guess what most of them wanted.) The point is that there are a lot of people out there with frail egos who somehow feel reassured of their self-worth by random strangers judging their physical attractiveness.

*What do you feel when you look in the mirror? Image generated by AI.*

It would be very easy to tell these people, with perfectly good intentions, that they should get off the apps. I believe this is where the pop culture usage of the term originates: someone noticed the masses searching for validation in romantic relationships and told them to find that validation elsewhere. They don't need to find love from a man, because they should already "love themselves."

There's just one small problem: validation is not love. When other people tell us that they *like* us for various reasons (e.g. good looks, intelligence, social skills), that's not love, that's infatuation. And if ever they found someone more good-looking or more intelligent or more sociable, they might abandon us at the drop of a hat and run off to the one they've decided is more *likable.* Replacing external compliments with internal affirmations is not self-love, but rather self-infatuation. It is pride; it is ego; it is the deadliest of the seven deadly sins. We have replaced neediness with narcissism.

It is dangerous to tie our sense of "self-love" to specific traits that we might like about ourselves, as challenging those traits can shatter our sense of identity. Upon encountering someone better than us, the ego will feel threatened and generate feelings of horrible envy towards that target. It might even try to protect itself by dragging the perceived threat down to its own level. It might say, "You can't possibly be more loving than *me*!" or perhaps, "You suffer from the same problems that I do, and if you don't admit it, that just means you're a massive hypocrite and also unempathetic to boot!" This leads to a vicious cycle wherein we become defensive and unable to accept even a hint of criticism, leading to even more feelings of envy when inevitably our skewed beliefs bump into reality. Toxic self-infatuation leads to a hatred for other people: a secret desire for them to fail.

This kind of narcissism pervades many of the self-help books you might find in the wild today. Take for example Mark Manson's article, titled [Fuck Yes or No](https://markmanson.net/fuck-yes). While Manson is right that we shouldn't try to win the approval of others out of neediness, he goes too far. Neither should we engage in narcissism to the point where we automatically assume that anyone who doesn't like us is not worth our time. Maybe there are valid reasons why people don't like us; maybe changing ourselves will help us grow wiser. (To his credit, Manson addresses this point, but only as an afterthought. His readers often forget about the fine print.) 

Both neediness and narcissism stem from a lack of true, unconditional self-love. If we attach flimsy conditions to our worth as human beings, we will obsessively try to validate that those conditions are met. Needy people find validation in the words of others, while narcissists find it in their own thoughts. Both approaches lead to pathological behavior in which we may seek to manipulate others or ourselves into painting overly rosy pictures of ourselves. True love is seeing the self with all of its flaws and weaknesses and cherishing it anyway. Only after we learn to give ourselves unconditional love can we offer it to others.

## My story

Before anyone accuses me of lacking empathy, I'll admit that I was once guilty of this narcissistic behavior. In public high school, I had prided myself on my intelligence and abilities in math; I was "the smart kid." But after transferring to the Illinois Math and Science Academy, I felt like a small fish in a big pond. In hindsight, I was still a pretty big fish, but the biggest fish at school was [James Tao](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=23076), a self-taught mathematical wunderkind who had won multiple gold medals at the IMO and made everybody else look idiotic. After realizing that I would never be able to achieve even a tiny fraction of his brilliance, I developed an inferiority complex.

While I'm ashamed to admit that I initially responded by trying to outdo other classmates, I eventually learned that I didn't have to be better than anyone at anything; my worth was not tied to my intelligence or academic achievements. I was an idiot compared to James, and that was okay. All I had to do was try my best, and that would be enough for me. Even better, I started volunteering as a tutor, so that I could help others to unlock their potential. Feeling stupid felt painful, but it made me a better person.

That was the beginning of my journey towards self-love, though it would take me a few more years to eliminate my egoic drives. Today, I am free of all envious feelings. When people try to reassure me that they don't want to make me feel inferior, I can only shrug, because thoughts of comparing myself hadn't even entered my head. I *don't care* if I am inferior in some way -- or even superior -- because I would love myself anyway. If someone points out my flaws, and their feedback makes sense to me, I will simply thank them and start brainstorming ways to improve. It would only make me happy if more people could reach this state of transparency and self-acceptance.

That is what it means to love the self and others. When someone asks you what you love about them, you should not say anything about their kindness, intelligence, or physical beauty. No, the most loving answer is the one I gave years ago, and which I think we should all strive to give ourselves:

> "I accept you as you are, and I will love you always. There is nothing that can change my love for you. Even if your beauty fades, your brain turns into a tangle of musty cobwebs, and you throw me away like a half-eaten piece of fruit, I will still love you. I hope that you become the best version of yourself that you possibly can."
>
> "I hope that you live a happy and meaningful life."
