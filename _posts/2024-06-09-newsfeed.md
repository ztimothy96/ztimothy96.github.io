I'm re-reading *System Design Interview: An Insider's Guide* by Alex Xu. Here's Chapter 11 on how to design a newsfeed system.

## Understand the problem
A newsfeed collects content across a website and displays it on a user's page for them to read. Think of services such as Twitter or Facebook, which once displayed content posted by a user's friends.

(Nowadays, they are filled with ads and spam. As you might suspect, I am not the greatest fan of newsfeeds in general. I think they have, in many ways, transformed into a massive detriment to societal well-being. Alas, software engineers get paid lots of money to build these systems, so we all have to learn about how to design one to pass interviews, regardless of whether we ever end up building one in real life.)

**Functional requirements**:
- *Newsfeed generation*: a user can see friends' posts on their newsfeed.
- *Feed publishing*: a user can make posts.
- *Newsfeed ordering*: for simplicity, we'll arrange posts in chronological order, although real-life systems use recommendation systems. (I found that the services fed me far more relevant content without them, but whatever...)
- *Media types*: a post can contain text, images, and videos.

**Non-functional requirements**:
- *Highly scalable*: everyone must use Facebook!
- *Highly available*: everyone must use Facebook at all times!
- *Highly performant*: when loading initial newsfeed. We want to catch the user's attention, or they might wander off to a different page, and then we won't be able to make money off advertising to them. What a tragedy.

The factory must grow!!

## High-level design

The API simply consists of two requests: newsfeed generation (GET) and publishing (POST). Let's design each of these workflows in turn.

### Newsfeed publishing

We can spam a vanilla architecture. However, to publish a post, we must perform three steps:
- write the post, 
- fan out the post to the publisher's friends, and 
- send notifications to those friends. 

Accordingly, we create three components in our API servers to separate those concerns. We also spam caches for the databases because caches improve latency. See the figure below.

### Newsfeed generation

Again, we're just spamming the vanilla architecture. We'll look more closely at this in the deep dive section.

### Newsfeed publishing

As they say: a picture is worth a thousand words. We need to figure out how to write posts, fan out the posts, and send notifications in more detail. Writing a post to the database and validating the cache is similar to fanning out posts to friends, while we already previously designed a notification service. So Xu only addresses the fan-out service in this chapter.

As with cache validation, there are two kinds of fan-out: on-read or on-write. On-read means that the post gets populated into a user's newsfeed when they make a read request; this slows down the request, but it may avoid unnecessary work when the user rarely logs in. On-write means that we push the post to the relevant feeds right away; this speeds up reads, but the write can take a long time if the user has many connections. We can get the best of both worlds by adopting a hybrid approach, where we use on-write fan-out for most users, and on-read fan-out for the most connected ones (like celebrities).

In the workflow, we first fetch the user's friends from a graph database. We can then figure out which friends we need to publish the post to by looking them up in the user database and running any filters found. We then send the list of friends and the post ID to a message queue. Finally, worker threads pull items from the queue and store (post ID, user ID) pairs in a newsfeed cache. Since it is unlikely that a user will scroll through thousands of posts, we only need to keep the most recent few items in the cache for each user.

### Newsfeed generation

Again, a picture is worth a thousand words.

![11-7](/assets/img/system-design/11-7.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

How does the newsfeed service generate feeds for a user? Ideally, it will take posts from the newsfeed cache, look up the post ID in the post database, and make fast queries to fill in all the required media for that post (such as images and videos). We can then return the reconstructed newsfeed to the client.

If we have a cache miss and can't find as many posts as a user would like, then we would have to run a database query. The service would find that user's friends and search the database for their most recent posts. This could likely be time-intensive.

Notice that Xu has extensively optimized for performance in this diagram by adding auxiliary components, especially caches. Caching is critical for a newsfeed because we want to generate the feed quickly, but searching for queries chronologically takes forever, and we'd like to avoid this as much as possible. Conveniently enough, we only want to grab the most recent posts, which are exactly what gets stored in a cache. We can cache not only the post IDs but also media content, social connections (friends and followers), counters (for likes and replies), and much more.

In a previous post, I noted that some components frequently pair well with each other to improve performance, like "peanut butter and jelly." Databases and caches stand out in this design. Other examples include the rate limiter and CDN paired with the API gateway. The diagram might look a bit complicated, but most of it is just extra fluff tacked on to reduce the workload on the core functional components (namely, API servers and database).

## Look back

In my opinion, this was an unusually instructive chapter that reinforced many previous lessons. Key takeaways from this design session:
- *Separate your workflows.* Once again, we separated the application into two main workflows: newsfeed publishing, and newsfeed generation. We then designed systems for these write and read operations respectively.
- *Separate your concerns.* We found that publishing a post required three steps, so we created separate components for each of them.
- *Hybrid is best.* Why choose between on-read or on-write newsfeed generation when you can have both?
- *Peanut butter jelly time.* Once again, some components frequently pair with each other to improve performance. Database with cache; rate limiter or CDN with API gateway.
- *Queues are glue.* Queues are useful when we want one component to talk to another one asynchronously. Here we used queues to send messages from our fan-out service to fan-out workers, which send newly published posts to friends' newsfeed caches.

I've heard that queues are to system design interviews what hash tables are to algorithm design interviews: they'll instantly solve 75% of your problems. After thinking about this example more, I think understand why. Queues are what we use to communicate between different modules of a software system, and when are we ever *not* going to want to modularize our design? (They are the analog of conveyor belts in Factorio, and if you've ever played that game, you'll know that we need to spam belts everywhere. Perhaps I'll write more about this parallel later.)
