Having watched *Inside Out 2* a while ago, I'd like to return to some thoughts on its prequel. *Inside Out* is a masterful movie by Pixar that psychologists have lauded for its accuracy in portraying the human mind; it is primarily about the usefulness of negative emotions. When Riley reacts to a personal crisis by kicking sadness out of her mind, she falls into depression and becomes unable to express her problems to others. Through this case study, the movie demonstrates exactly why humans need to feel sadness: it allows us to identify stressors and call for help from our loved ones.

While the original movie focuses on sadness, I'd like to turn attention to another negative emotion that is often maligned and suppressed: anger. 

## Christian tradition on anger

While I do not believe in the literal truth of the Bible, I do consider myself culturally Christian in the sense of aligning with its values and ethical principles. After all, these values have built up healthy, robust civilizations and spread to what is now a third of the world's population; they have endured the test of time. So I'll begin by explaining what Christian teachings have to say about anger.

In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ tells his followers: 

> “You have heard that it was said to an older generation, ‘Do not murder,’ and ‘whoever murders will be subjected to judgment.’ But I say to you that anyone who is angry with a brother will be subjected to judgment. And whoever insults a brother will be brought before the council, and whoever says ‘Fool’ will be sent to fiery hell."

Given such a stern warning, a casual reader might be forgiven for thinking that anger necessarily results in controlling or hurting other people (hence the comparison to murder), and therefore we should suppress this emotion at all costs.

However, a more holistic reading reveals that Christ is speaking hyperbolically; in the same passage, he also suggests that we gouge out our eyes to avoid lust, which no sane person would ever do. So a more nuanced reader might instead equate these two overreactions. While Christ warns us about the severity of sins such as lust and murder, he also slyly suggests that avoiding anger altogether, like gouging your eyes out, is... a bit impractical.

In reality, the Bible makes it extremely clear that anger plays an important role in healthy emotional regulation. This is best exemplified in the Old Testament, where God is often angry and smites down civilizations when they disobey him. But even if you're a Gnostic who wants to redact the entire OT with some *Timaeus*-style Demiurge fanfiction, the New Testament still insists on much the same message. The Apostle Paul writes: "'In your anger do not sin': Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry," confirming that there is nothing wrong with feeling anger, as long as it does not turn into a long-term grudge. Even Jesus himself demonstrated anger on many occasions, such as when he cleared the temple by whipping merchants inside, or when he insulted the Pharisees: "You snakes! You brood of vipers!" Despite efforts to convince us that Jesus only felt sadness for the Pharisees, and not anger, I find it difficult to imagine anybody cussing in a calm tone of voice. Let's face it: healthy anger is a fact of Christian scripture.

(By the way, I am not the first person to think that the Gnostic mashup of Hellenistic and Jewish traditions is utterly ridiculous. Such criticisms date back to the Neoplatonic philosopher [Plotinus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/), who essentially wrote that cherry-picking from Plato and Christ corrupted the teaching of *both* thinkers; after all, Plato originally imagined the Demiurge as a benevolent being, not the malevolent one heretics would have you believe. Gnosticism is not a shiny new idea; it's one of the oldest extant heresies, and has been debunked countless times over the centuries by everybody they ever stole ideas from.)

Like its companions - joy, sadness, fear, and even disgust - anger is a core human emotion. It is necessary for human flourishing, but its excess leads to destructive behavior. It is a volatile emotion that must be carefully controlled. The [APA](https://www.apa.org/topics/anger) would agree.

## The benefits of anger

It's easy for me to claim that anger is an inevitable part of the human experience. But what is it good for? Since it is a core human emotion, it must have evolved because it plays a vital role in human flourishing, just like all the other core emotions. That's why I believe it's important to explore its function in more detail.

Perhaps it is easier to explain the role of anger in an analogy with other negative emotions, like fear. It is easy enough to describe why we have fear: it helps us to identify and keep away from dangers, which in turn helps us survive. For instance, if we touch a hot stove, our fingers will burn in pain, and then we will learn to feel afraid of fires. This fear will then prevent us from touching other hot things in the future so that we no longer damage ourselves. In that way, fear promotes human health.

Note that all emotions can be developed to excess, at which point they begin to damage us rather than keep us safe. Excessive fear, for instance, creates phobias; people with pyrophobia may become so paralyzed that they are unable to cook food, go camping, or even talk about fire. That's why we have to maintain a healthy balance, which Aristotle calls the "golden mean": control over emotions so that they do not run to excess or fall into deficits. This is the key to all good living. 

(Pixar once again eloquently expresses this idea through film. The sequel, *Inside Out 2*, deals in large part with the idea of controlling your emotions, instead of letting them control you!)

At this point, some might object: why do we need emotions to regulate our behavior? Instead of feeling fear, why not just apply cold logic and reason? Perhaps we could simply learn that "fire is hot," and learn to not stick our fingers onto hot stoves. Then we can stay safe from burns without the risk of developing pyrophobia.

That idea sounds reasonable in principle, but it doesn't work in practice. After all, people are usually not motivated by rationality, but by emotion in their decision-making. Sensations of pain and fear give immediate feedback, allowing us to make decisions quickly and instinctively before it's too late. Negative emotions allow us to detect and act on threats much more quickly and energetically than would be possible otherwise. Imagine trying to carry around a list of all the things that you're supposed to fear or avoid; that thought process would prove much too cumbersome, and your finger would be burned off before you remembered that fire was bad for you!

In many ways, anger is the ideal partner to fear in protecting the self from external threats. When humans meet with aggression, we experience a fight-or-flight response which helps us to escape danger. Fear prompts flights; anger fights. If we're a prehistoric human hunting down a woolly mammoth, we don't want to run away from it; we need to attack it directly and win so that we can have food to last us through the harsh winter. Sometimes we need to fight, and that's when anger can save the day.

Since anger is the emotion that prepares us for conflict, it enhances our capabilities and boosts our chances of winning. A [BBC summary article](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200723-how-anger-can-be-put-to-good-use) on anger mentions that the emotion unlocks greater physical ability, mental agility, and overall persistence on a wide array of tasks, including everything from basketball to word puzzles. That's why moderately angry people are better at negotiating and confronting others. As much as an idealist might want to replace anger with cold rationality, this isn't going to work. The person who knows how to channel their anger will simply be stronger, smarter, and more resilient, and they're going to win the fight; the one who doesn't will lose.


## The dangers of anger

Despite all the benefits that anger confers, many people seem to fear it above all other emotions. As we've seen, this attitude persists in religious texts, which place a great number of cautions against its excesses. And for good reason!

This distinction is due to the incredibly destructive external effects of unbridled anger, compared to the other emotions. An excessively joyful person may become [delusionally optimistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxL1tayNwmM); an excessively sad or fearful person, paralyzed. But in these cases, the damage falls mostly on the person suffering from excess. In contrast, excessively angry people have an appetite for conflict, and the emotion bestows them with a heightened ability to win, making them dangerous for anyone who crosses their path. Thus, the dangers fall on innocent bystanders as well.

Due to its destructive power, some people become so afraid of anger that they demonize it and suppress it in themselves. But disabling one's internal warning system comes with a heavy price. From personal experience, the people who struggle to feel anger are also the ones who are most unable to identify their own needs and communicate them. They are also most likely to emotionally implode when those needs aren't met, with disastrous results. To feel better about these obvious failings, the insufficiently angry may justify their passivity as some kind of moral high ground. "I am not using anger to protect myself," they may say, "because I do not feel the need to protect myself. I have discarded my ego; I am selfless!"

But it is not selfish or egotistical to display anger; it is a sign of self-love. The person who truly cares about their well-being will seek to protect themselves one way or another. When faced with a fight-or-flight response, those who cannot fight will opt for flight; we will run away from problems if we don't believe in our ability to tackle them head-on. This survival tactic would certainly help to live another day, but exclusive reliance on flight doesn't sound like the kind of strategy that would enable human flourishing.

We should not seek to eliminate anger; instead, we must learn to control it. And then, we will become both powerful and good. Nietzsche once wrote:
> “Of all evil I deem you capable: Therefore I want good from you. Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good because they had no claws.”

Do you have claws?
