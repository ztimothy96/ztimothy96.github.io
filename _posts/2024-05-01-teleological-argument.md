Recently, some people have been trying again to convert me to Christianity. I don't go out of my way to argue about whether or not God exists, but if other people are going to throw a bunch of logical arguments at me, then you can bet I'm going to examine those arguments with fair skepticism. While I've heard many variants of such arguments over the years, I still value having these talks, because once in a while they teach me something new. This time I found out that my previous objections to the teleological argument are quite silly, and there is a much simpler, more convincing reason that such arguments don't work.

First, let's begin with a quick introduction to teleological arguments.

## What is a teleological argument?

Good question! These are "arguments from design," also known as "watchmaker" or "fine-tuning" arguments. The idea goes that life is highly unlikely to arise by chance, so it is highly probable that there must be some intelligent Creator figure who designed the universe to make life possible. The nickname "watchmaker argument" arose from the analogy that life is intricate and complex like a watch, so it must have a designer, just as watches are made by a watchmaker.

The watchmaker analogy somewhat fell out of favor after Darwin published *The Origin of Species*, showing how evolutionary selection could give rise to complex, seemingly "designed" phenomena like natural speciation. Darwin's theory was not intended to explain the origins of life, but only how existing life can diverge into various forms. However, since intelligent design was the only method of design that natural philosophers were previously aware of, Darwin shocked the world with the discovery of a naturalistic alternative. Once it became clear that other paradigms existed, philosophers started to feel less assured about the necessity of intelligence to produce life. The teleological arguments no longer wielded the same persuasive power they once possessed; atheism suddenly seemed much more *plausible.*

In more recent times, with the discovery of things like the Big Bang and modern models of cosmology, some religious apologists have pointed to the "fine-tuned" values of physical constants as evidence for a universe divinely designed to support life. "If only the strong nuclear force were 5% stronger," one might argue, "then life would not be possible." We might then conclude that it is highly unlikely that the strong force could have attained such a delicate balance with the other fundamental forces unless there was an intelligent designer involved.

Previously, I would have objected to such fine-tuning arguments from a purely probabilistic point of view. Nowadays, I think my approach was fundamentally misguided. Adopting a physics perspective, we can find much stronger reasons to reject teleological arguments for God; I'll address each of these in turn.

## The probabilistic objection

At first, I thought the problem with fine-tuning arguments lay with unfounded assumptions about probability. Consider the formula for such an argument: "If only constant $$X$$ were different by $$Y$$ amount, then life would be impossible; the universe we live in is therefore highly unlikely." How did we determine that the current values are unlikely? If we're going to compute some kind of probability, we have to first specify a probability distribution over the possible values. So, what is the permitted range of values for the strong force constant? The cosmological constant? The force of the Big Bang? And so on...

Sometimes we may feel impressed by fine-tuning statements of the form above if $$Y$$ is a very small number, like 5% for the strong force, or perhaps even $$10^{-100}$$ for some fancy cosmological constant I'm not aware of. But at the end of the day, whether a number is "small" depends on context and application. A meter might seem like a moderate length for many physics problems, but it is tiny if we are working in cosmology, and it is gigantic if we are thinking about quantum physics. This is because the topics study objects with dramatically different distributions of scale. Similarly, if we want to make a big deal about the strong force falling within a 5% range, we should make sure there isn't some hidden physical constraint that restricts strong force values to only a 1% difference. (Otherwise, the fine-tuning argument would become vacuous and fall apart.) We always have to think about the distribution of values we expect to see.

Unfortunately for proponents of such arguments, there is no way for us to observe nontrivial distributions of physical constants for different universes, for the simple reason that we can only observe one universe: ours. As such, we have no way of measuring the standard deviation on any of these constants or making statistically meaningful statements about how likely they are to fall within some range.

I thought this objection sounded reasonable when I first came up with it. However, I now acknowledge that it is silly, for the same reason that teleological arguments are silly. Namely: such constants are not real, and it doesn't even make sense to talk about them having a probability distribution.

## The physical objection

To see what I mean by physical constants not being "real," let's look at a simple toy problem. Imagine that we're doing basic kinematics; we know the acceleration of a car over time and would like to find out its change in position after some time units have elapsed. So we can do the usual thing that everybody learns in grade school: set the initial time $$t_0 = 0$$ and initial position $$x_0 = 0$$, write the acceleration as a function of time $$a(t)$$, and take a double integral to find the position at any time $$x(t)$$. Then we can know how much the position has changed between times $$0$$ and $$t$$.

But there's something suspicious about this procedure, which any beginning physics student should be able to point out: half the numbers we set here don't correspond to anything in physical reality. For instance, it doesn't matter what we set the initial position or initial time to be; we could have picked $$t_0 = 1000000$$ and the resulting change in position would have come out the same. Since our model of the world is translation-invariant in space and time, it doesn't make physical sense to talk about whether the car's position has value $$x=0$$ or whether it started moving at time $$t=0$$. Those coordinate systems were arbitrary constructs that we picked for convenient calculation. We could have picked those values to be anything, as long as they correctly predicted the physically observable quantities: namely, the *changes* in space and time.

However, the same is true for pretty much any model of physics. At the end of the day, physical constants are not "real;" they are merely mental constructs that we conjure up in our theories to predict the observable behavior of the world. For instance, the Newtonian gravitational constant, $$G \approx 6.6743 \times 10^{–11} m^3 kg^{–1} s^{–2}$$, is not real. It does not have a physical existence; it is simply a constant that we plug in so that the Newtonian model of gravity can give us good predictions. However, at sufficiently large scales, classical mechanics breaks down, and we will have to abandon it in favor of a more sophisticated model of gravity, such as general relativity. Who's to say that, someday, we won't replace relativity with a theory of quantum gravity that doesn't include the constant $$G$$ at all?

It makes no sense to quibble about whether the universe would support life if only the value of $$G$$ were different by, say, a little more than $$1.5 \times 10^{–15} m^3 kg^{–1} s^{–2}$$ (which is the measurement error of $$G$$). Physicists, not God, picked this value so that classical mechanics can give good predictions; and for that matter, physicists, not God, created classical mechanics. Despite our many successes, the actual universe is much more complicated and mysterious than what we puny humans can capture through mathematical models.

Teleological arguments are correct to assert that the physical constants of the universe are fine-tuned to support life. However, they are mistaken about who did the tuning. We humans created these mathematical models of physics, and we are the ones who tune their constants so that they correctly predict the behavior of the observable universe. Surprise, surprise; the probability of such constants allowing for life to exist is 100%. If we ever created a model whose constants did not predict the possibility of life, we would simply say, "This theory of physics is garbage," and throw it away. And then, we'd invent a better one.
