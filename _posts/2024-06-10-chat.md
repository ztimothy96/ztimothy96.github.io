I'm re-reading *System Design Interview: An Insider's Guide* by Alex Xu. Here's Chapter 12 on how to design a chat application.

## Understand the problem
A chat application, like Facebook Messenger, WeChat, WhatsApp, or Line, allows people to sign up and send each other messages. Different chat apps will prioritize different applications. (For instance, Discord was originally built for gaming communities.)

**Functional requirements**:
- *Platforms*: support both mobile and web.
- *Chat size*: app should support both 1-on-1 and group chats. Let's say that a group chat can hold at most 100 people.
- *Media*: for now, messages include only text, but not images or videos.
- *Message size*: say fewer than 100,000 characters.
- *Message retention*: store all messages permanently.
- *Presence service*: the service should be able to tell whether a user is online or offline.

**Non-functional requirements**:
- *Highly scalable.* Assume we have tens of millions of daily active users (DAU).
- *Highly available.* Users can chat each other any time they want.

## High-level design

We once again start by pulling out the vanilla architecture and modifying it to meet functional requirements. There's nothing too surprising about the users, API gateway, or databases yet. However, the API servers perform several different tasks, so we need to separate concerns.

There are at least three different services our system must perform: collect user data on signup, send messages to chats, and push notifications when users receive messages. Sending real-time messages and detecting user presence are stateful services which we'll delve into more later. Meanwhile, user signup can be handled by API servers with stateless HTTP requests, and the notifications can be outsourced to a third-party serivce. Creating independent components for each type of service (stateful, stateless, third-party), we get a design diagram like the one below.

If a user wants to connect to chat, it sends a request to an API server, which can find an available chat server through a monitoring service (e.g. Zookeeper). The user can then connect to the chat server directly via Websocket and request that it send messages. 

Having drafted a simple design, we now have to think about how these different components are going to talk to each other.

### Connection protocol

When a client sends a request to the server, we can use HTTP as usual. However, we can't use it for the server to send messages to the client, because the recipient isn't going to be waiting for a message and it's probably not online most of the time. There are a couple of protocols we could try.

- *Polling*: the client periodically asks the server if there are any new messages. This can waste lots of effort as there won't be updates most of the time.
- *Long polling*: the client holds the connection open until it gets a response or the connection times out. This requires less polling, but the same server might not have all the messages sent to the client, and it's hard for the server to tell when the client has logged out.
- *Websocket*: an upgraded version of HTTP where both the client and server can send each other real-time messages. We probably don't need to discuss this in too much detail.

Websockets are ideal for chat applications because we need real-time two-way communication, but they consume more server resources and are stateful, making them harder to scale. Therefore, we can get the best of both worlds by taking a hybrid approach: we can use HTTP for user signups and only use Websockets for the chat servers that need real-time messaging capabilities.

### Database
There are two types of data in a chat service. The first is typical account data such as usernames, passwords, and lists of friends. This can go in a relational database since it's structured and probably not too massive in scale.

Then there's chat data, which stores all the messages. In a typical chat service, most requests will ask to read the most recent messages in a chat a small constant number of times. On rare occassions, a search request will ask to read arbitrary messages from the database. Due to the massive scale of message data, we may want to use a NoSQL database like a key-value store.

It might be good to think a bit about how we want to set up the database schema for messages. For a one-on-one chat, we could store a message ID, sender ID, recipient ID, timestamp, and message content. I'm not going into detail here because I want to focus on the high-level design.

## Detailed design

Now we can go deeper into the design and describe workflows for each functional requirement: how to send messages, sync messages across devices, detect user presence, and so on.

### Sending messages

Let's say Alice and Bob are friends on a chat service. How does Alice send a message to Bob? Once again, a picture is worth a thousand words.

When Alice sends a message, her chat server will push it to a queue for processing. This way, the system can notify Bob of the message even if he is offline. The server will also generate an ID for the message and store it in the key-value store. This way, if the message fails to deliver, we can retrieve its text from the store and retry.

### Syncing messages across devices

Supposing Alice has a phone and a laptop, how can we make sure that they both have access to all the messages? Syncing messages across devices is conceptually pretty simple: we have to make sure that both devices have seen all the messages in the chat. We can store this total count in a distributed counter. When Alice opens the chat app on her device, we can compare the message count on her device with the total count, then retrieve all the unseen messages from the database.

### User presence

Now how do we keep track of when a user comes online or offline? We would have to first detect a presence change and then push that to the user's friends.

Detecting a change is relatively simple. We keep another key-value store mapping user IDs to presence status. If a user comes online, we update their value in the store. If a user drops offline, we don't want to make an update every time their Internet connection is a bit shaky, so we can instead send regular heartbeats from the user to the presence server. If we don't receive a heartbeat after a while, say 5 minutes, then we update the status to offline in the database. 

Status updates can then be pushed to the user's friends by dropping them in queues for each of the friends. This works well as long as the user doesn't have millions of online friends. (Seems like a pretty reasonable assumption, because come on, who has that many friends?)

## Look back
Here are some key takeaways from this design session. Some of the lessons learned should look pretty familiar by now.
- *Separate your concerns.* We separated application servers into three types according to the connection protocol.
- *Queues are glue.* We push messages between users using queues whenever we need asynchronous communication. For instance, we use queues to push messages to offline users and to send laggy presence updates.
- *Hybrid is best.* We used different communication protocols (HTTPS, Websockets) for different components depending on their needs. We also used different kinds of databases (SQL, NoSQL key-value stores) depending on how much data we needed to store and whether that data displayed tabular structure. These choices did not change the basic functionality of the system, but rather helped it to meet non-functional requirements. 

Given time, there are more improvements we could make to this system, such as:
- Add more media types. This requires more separation concerns and hybrid storage solutions: put images and videos in a blob store, and compress large files.
- Encrypt messages.
- *Peanut butter jelly time:* add caches and CDN for faster performance.
