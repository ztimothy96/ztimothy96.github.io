This is part of a series in which I learn about basic quantum computing from a series YouTube [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfjN7MmSB6g&list=PLkvhuSoxwjI_UudECvFYArvG0cLbFlzSr). This post will introduce qubits and the basic principles of quantum mechanics, covering lectures 1 through 7. Later on, I might discuss how to solve algorithmic problems using these principles.

## The classical computing world

Before we start talking about quantum computing, we should first understand how classical computing works, so that we can compare it to its quantum analogue. Classical computers store information in bits, and we already know a lot about them!
- **State space.** Each bit can be in only one of two possible states, $$\vert 0 \rangle$$ or $$\vert 1 \rangle$$. We might physically implement one by turning an electrical switch on and off.
- **Observation.**We can easily observe the state of each bit without changing it. For instance, we can measure whether there is any current flowing through an electrical wire.
- **Combining bits.** We can combine multiple bits by taking the Cartesian product of their state spaces, so that $$n$$ bits can represent $$2^n$$ possible states.
    For instance, with two bits, the possible states are $$\vert 00 \rangle, \vert 01 \rangle, \vert 10 \rangle, \vert 11 \rangle$$. We can identify each state with the numbers $$0$$ through $$2^n-1$$ by converting the bits to binary numbers.

Seems intuitive enough! But once we start building machines at the atomic scale, the laws of quantum mechanics take over, and we instead have to work with *quantum* bits, or qubits. Here things get a little more... complex. Let's see how each of the observations above carry over to the quantum realm.

## Observing qubits

Whereas classical bits are elements in a discrete set, qubits are unit vectors in a complex Hilbert space. Not only can qubits take on classical states like $$\vert 0 \rangle$$ and $$\vert 1 \rangle$$, but they can also take on superpositions of these states, $$\alpha = \alpha_0 \vert 0 \rangle + \alpha_1 \vert 1 \rangle, \alpha_i \in \mathbb{C}$$. 

Weirdly enough, observing the value of a qubit changes its state! This is called the [observer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)). If we measure a qubit $$\alpha = \alpha_0 \vert 0 \rangle + \alpha_1 \vert 1 \rangle$$ with respect to the standard basis $$\vert 0 \rangle, \vert 1 \rangle$$, then the qubit will flip to state $$\vert 0 \rangle$$ with probability $$\vert \vert \alpha_0 \vert \vert^2$$ and to state $$\vert 1 \rangle$$ with probability $$ \vert \vert \alpha_1 \vert \vert^2$$. It's not clear why the universe should behave in such a jittery way, but that's what the experiments reveal.

More generally, if we observe the qubit $$\alpha$$ with respect to an orthonormal basis $$\{ v_i \}$$, then the probability of the qubit collapsing to state $$v_i$$ is its length along that direction, $$ \vert \vert \langle \alpha \vert v_i \rangle \vert \vert^2$$. Orthonormal states are mutually exclusive; the qubit must collapse exactly one of the states, but can't remain in a superposition between them. Since our qubit must collapse to exactly one of the states after observation, the probabilities have to add up to $$1$$. This is why we represent quantum states as *unit* vectors. Put mathematically, $$\vert \vert \alpha \vert \vert^2 = \sum_i \vert \vert \langle \alpha \vert v_i \rangle \vert \vert^2 = 1$$. 

## State space: the Bloch sphere
Let's try to understand what the state space looks like. Whereas a bit can be either $$0$$ or $$1$$, a qubit can be in infinitely many states. How do these states relate to each other geometrically?

When we observe a qubit, the probabilities of each collapse don't change if we multiply the qubit by a phase. That is, if $$z \in \mathbb{C}$$ is on the unit circle, then the probability that qubit $$z \alpha$$ collapses to state $$v_i$$ is still $$\vert \vert z \langle \alpha \vert v_i \rangle \vert \vert ^2 = \vert z \vert ^2 \vert \vert \langle \alpha \vert v_i \rangle \vert \vert ^2 = \vert \vert \langle \alpha \vert v_i \rangle \vert \vert ^2$$. Thus, the state $$\alpha$$ induces the same physical behavior as $$z\alpha$$, and multiplying the qubit by a global phase $$z$$ doesn't change anything in the physical world. We only care about the angles *between the qubit's components*; rotating all of them at once won't affect our physical experiments.

Overall, each qubit has two degrees of freedom. Initially, we have four degrees of freedom for choosing its complex coordinates, but we lose two degrees due to the unit vector and global phase constraints. Hence, we should be able to represent the state space of a single qubit on some sort of 2-dimensional surface.

We can visualize the state space as a *Bloch sphere*. The north pole represents $$\vert 0 \rangle$$, while the south pole represents state $$\vert 1 \rangle$$. Traveling down the meridian corresponds to increasing the probability that the state collapses to $$\vert 1 \rangle$$. Traveling around the equator corresponds to rotating the angle between the two qubit components in the complex plane.

It's easier to understand this with some concrete examples.
- The state $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1 \rangle)$$ is antipodal to $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0 \rangle - \vert 1 \rangle)$$.
- The state $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0 \rangle + i \vert 1 \rangle)$$ lies halfway between them. 
- However, $$\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1 \rangle)$$ represents the same state as $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1 \rangle)$$, because you can rotate one by $$i$$ to get the other. 

## Combining qubits and entanglement
Just as we can combine bits by taking Cartesian products, we can combine multiple qubits by taking the tensor product of their state spaces. While each qubit is a complex vector in $$\mathbb{C}^2$$, a system of $$n$$ qubits is a vector in $$\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$$, corresponding to the $$2^n$$ classical states. 

If we have a bunch of qubits doing their own thing, it's pretty easy to put them side-by-side and compute the state of the combined system. For instance, suppose we have two qubits, $$\alpha_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(i \vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1 \rangle)$$, and $$\alpha_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0 \rangle - \vert 1 \rangle)$$. Then their joint state is the tensor product,  

$$
\begin{align} 
\alpha_1 \otimes \alpha_2 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(i \vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1 \rangle) \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0 \rangle - \vert 1 \rangle) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}(i \vert 00 \rangle - i \vert 01 \rangle + \vert 10 \rangle - \vert 11 \rangle).
\end{align}
$$

But is it possible to go in the reverse direction? If we have a collection of qubits, can we figure out the states of each qubit?

In classical computing, this is easy; given a collection of bits, just look at each bit and write down the number you see. But in quantum computing, we can't always factor a collection of qubits into individual states. We can prove this by counting the state space dimensions. Each qubit has $$2$$ degrees of freedom, so putting them side-by-side yields $$2^n$$ degrees of freedom. But their combined state is a $$2^n$$-dimensional complex vector, subject to two constraints (unit vector, global phase). Thus, there are $$2^{n+1} - 2$$ degrees of freedom for a system of $$n$$ qubits. When $$n > 1$$, there are more degrees of freedom in the ensemble than in the isolated qubits!

For a more concrete example of a state that can't be factored into a tensor product, consider the Bell state $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 00 \rangle + \vert 11 \rangle)$$. Intuitively, when we observe one qubit, the other must collapse to the same value; they are either both $$0$$ or both $$1$$. These qubits spookily interact with each other in a way that is not possible in classical computing. Since these states cannot be factored into states for each qubit, we say that the qubits are *entangled.*

As a review, we've seen how quantum computers represent information as qubits, which can be superpositions of classical bits. A qubit's state space is trickier to think about, but we can visualize it using a Bloch sphere. Observing qubits can collapse their superpositions, and qubits can even affect each other's observations through entanglement. Next time, I should talk about how to perform logical operations on qubits...
